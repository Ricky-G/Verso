/// <summary>
/// Identifies the version of the message protocol spoken across the isolated-layout

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The protocol is the set of framework message types exchanged between host and
/// renderer (the <c>verso/</c> namespace) plus their payload shapes. The host advertises
/// <see cref="Version"/> to the renderer in the <c>verso/init</c> message
/// (<c>hostProtocolVersion</c>), and a renderer declares the version it was built against
/// through <see cref="LayoutRendererPackage.RendererProtocolVersion"/>. Either side can
/// compare the two to detect a mismatch instead of failing opaquely on an unrecognized
/// message.
/// <para>
/// The version uses a <c>major.minor</c> form. A change to the major component signals an
/// incompatible protocol; a minor bump signals backward-compatible additions (for example
/// a new optional field on an existing message).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// 1.1 added the optional <c>uiCulture</c> field to <c>verso/init</c>, naming the language
/// the host's interface is drawn in.
