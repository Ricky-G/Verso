# Extensions

Verso's extension system lets third-party authors ship language kernels, cell renderers, themes, layouts, magic commands, toolbar actions, formatters, and more. Every built-in feature uses the same public interfaces available to extensions, so what you can do with an extension matches what the platform itself can do.

The docs below cover everything an extension author needs, from a first `dotnet new verso-extension` to packaging and publishing.

If you only want to install and manage existing extensions rather than build one, see the [Managing Extensions](../guides/managing-extensions.md) guide.

## Getting started

- **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)**: scaffold an extension project, register it with the host, and run it locally.

## Reference

- **[Extension Interfaces](extension-interfaces.md)**: every interface in `Verso.Abstractions` and the capability surface each exposes.
- **[Context Reference](context-reference.md)**: `IVersoContext`, `IExtensionHostContext`, and the services an extension can reach through them.

## Authoring guides

- **[Layouts](layouts.md)**: write a custom layout extension. Covers both renderer isolation modes: **inline** layouts (`ILayoutEngine`, the `data-cell-slot` slot-mount pattern, data-attribute event routing, the `ILayoutInteractionHandler` capability, the re-render protocol, theming against host CSS variables) and **isolated** iframe layouts (`RendererIsolation`, the renderer package, the `window.verso` bridge, `ILayoutLifecycleHandler` and the frame channel, the message contract, the sandbox/CSP policy, and theme-token propagation).
- **[Panels](panels.md)**: contribute a panel next to the notebook body. Covers the representation contract (`INotebookPanel`, ordered alternates, why a panel describes content instead of drawing it), the icon set, the interaction round trip (`IPanelInteractionHandler`, `RequestRefresh`), and the CSS class vocabulary the web host provides.
- **[Theme Authoring](theme-authoring.md)**: define color palettes, typography, and the layout-extension theme tokens that custom layouts inherit through CSS custom properties.
- **[Localization](localization.md)**: follow the reader's interface language: keep strings in a resource file, read `IVersoContext.UICulture` where a culture is needed explicitly, hand an isolated renderer its strings on mount, and test that every string resolves on each access.

## Workflow

- **[Testing Extensions](testing-extensions.md)**: the `Verso.Testing` library, `StubVersoContext`, and patterns for unit-testing each capability.
- **[Packaging and Publishing](packaging-and-publishing.md)**: produce a NuGet package, distribute through public or private feeds, and version your extension across host releases.
- **[Best Practices](best-practices.md)**: state management, thread safety, security considerations, and conventions that play well with the broader ecosystem.
